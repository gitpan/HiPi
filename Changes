Version 0.24  - 19 March 2013
              - Added hipi-i2c command line utility to allow none Perl code
                access to i2c commands.
              - All calls to external programs ( cat, echo etc. ) are now
                taint safe.
              - Installation now always does an apt-get update before 
                apt-get install (depedency list). My test builds
                often fail at dependency installation time if apt-get update
                is not executed.

              - Added HiPi::Interface::MPL3115A2 - to demonstrate repeated
                start operation using HiPi::BCM2835::I2C
              - Updated all i2c using interface modules to accept smbus, i2c
                or bcm2835 backends
